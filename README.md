# Pizza_Sales_Analysis

### KPI:-
I analyzed key indicators for pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance. Specifically, I calculate the following metrics using SQL queries and also by using measure in Power BI:

1. **Total Revenue:** The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value:** The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold:** The sum of the quantities of all pizza sold.
4. **Total Orders:** The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizza Per Order:** The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

### Visualization:-
I want to visualize various aspects of pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. I have identified the following requirements for the creating charts in Power BI:

1. **Daily trend for total Orders:** Created a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.
2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders:** Created a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout that day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:** Created a pie that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into that popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:** Generated a pie chart that represents that percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us to understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.
5. **Total Pizza Sold by Pizza Category:** Created a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.
